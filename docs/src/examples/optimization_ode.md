# Optimization of Ordinary Differential Equations

## Copy-Paste Code

If you want to just get things running, try the following! Explanation will
follow.

```julia
using DifferentialEquations, DiffEqFlux, Plots

function lotka_volterra!(du, u, p, t)
  x, y = u
  α, β, δ, γ = p
  du[1] = dx = α*x - β*x*y
  du[2] = dy = -δ*y + γ*x*y
end

# Initial condition
u0 = [1.0, 1.0]

# Simulation interval and intermediary points
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
tsteps = 0.0:0.1:10.0

# LV equation parameter. p = [α, β, δ, γ]
p = [1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0]

# Setup the ODE problem, then solve
prob = ODEProblem(lotka_volterra!, u0, tspan, p)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())

# Plot the solution
using Plots
plot(sol)
savefig("LV_ode.png")

function loss(p)
  sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), p=p, saveat = tsteps)
  loss = sum(abs2, sol.-1)
  return loss, sol
end

callback = function (p, l, pred)
  display(l)
  plt = plot(pred, ylim = (0, 6))
  display(plt)
  # Tell sciml_train to not halt the optimization. If return true, then
  # optimization stops.
  return false
end

result_ode = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss, p,
                                    cb = callback,
                                    maxiters = 100)
# result_ode = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss, p, ADAM(0.1), cb = callback)
```

## Explanation

First let's create a Lotka-Volterra ODE using DifferentialEquations.jl. For
more details, [see the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/dev/). The Lotka-Volterra equations have the form:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \alpha x - \beta x y      \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= -\delta y + \gamma x y    \\
\end{aligned}
```

```julia
using DifferentialEquations, DiffEqFlux, Plots

function lotka_volterra!(du, u, p, t)
  x, y = u
  α, β, δ, γ = p
  du[1] = dx = α*x - β*x*y
  du[2] = dy = -δ*y + γ*x*y
end

# Initial condition
u0 = [1.0, 1.0]

# Simulation interval and intermediary points
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
tsteps = 0.0:0.1:10.0

# LV equation parameter. p = [α, β, δ, γ]
p = [1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0]

# Setup the ODE problem, then solve
prob = ODEProblem(lotka_volterra!, u0, tspan, p)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())

# Plot the solution
using Plots
plot(sol)
savefig("LV_ode.png")
```

For this first example, we do not yet include a neural network. We take
[AD-compatible `solve`
function](https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/analysis/sensitivity/) function
that takes the parameters and an initial condition and returns the solution of
the differential equation. Next we choose a loss function. Our goal will be to
find parameters that make the Lotka-Volterra solution constant `x(t)=1`, so we
define our loss as the squared distance from 1. Note that when using
`sciml_train`, the first return is the loss value, and the other returns are
sent to the callback for monitoring convergence.

```julia
function loss(p)
  sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), p=p, saveat = tsteps)
  loss = sum(abs2, sol.-1)
  return loss, sol
end
```

Lastly, we use the `sciml_train` function to train the parameters using `ADAM` to
arrive at parameters which optimize for our goal. `sciml_train` allows defining
a callback that will be called at each step of our training loop. It takes in
the current parameter vector and the returns of the last call to the loss
function. We will display the current loss and make a plot of the current
situation:

```julia
callback = function (p, l, pred)
  display(l)
  plt = plot(pred, ylim = (0, 6))
  display(plt)
  # Tell sciml_train to not halt the optimization. If return true, then
  # optimization stops.
  return false
end
```

Let's optimize the model.

```julia
result_ode = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss, p, cb = callback)
```

In just seconds we found parameters which give a relative loss of `1e-16`! We can
get the final loss with `result_ode.minimum`, and get the optimal parameters
with `result_ode.u`. For example, we can plot the final outcome and show
that we solved the control problem and successfully found parameters to make the
ODE solution constant:

```julia
remade_solution = solve(remake(prob, p = result_ode.u), Tsit5(),      
                        saveat = tsteps)
plot(remade_solution, ylim = (0, 6))
```

Note that this was done with the default optimizer. One can also pass an
optimization method, like `ADAM(0.1)`, and tweak settings like set `maxiters=100`
to force at most 100 iterations of the optimization. This looks like:

```julia
result_ode = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss, p, ADAM(0.1), cb = callback, maxiters=100)
```

[sciml_train](@ref sciml_train) documentation
