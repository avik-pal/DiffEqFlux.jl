# Neural Stochastic Differential Equations

With neural stochastic differential equations, there is once again a helper form
`neural_dmsde` which can be used for the multiplicative noise case (consult the
layers API documentation, or [this full example using the layer
function](https://github.com/MikeInnes/zygote-paper/blob/master/neural_sde/neural_sde.jl)).

However, since there are far too many possible combinations for the API to
support, in many cases you will want to performantly define neural differential
equations for non-ODE systems from scratch. For these systems, it is generally
best to use `TrackerAdjoint` with non-mutating (out-of-place) forms. For
example, the following defines a neural SDE with neural networks for both the
drift and diffusion terms:

```julia
dudt(u, p, t) = model(u)
g(u, p, t) = model2(u)
prob = SDEProblem(dudt, g, x, tspan, nothing)
```

where `model` and `model2` are different neural networks. The same can apply to
a neural delay differential equation. Its out-of-place formulation is
`f(u,h,p,t)`. Thus for example, if we want to define a neural delay differential
equation which uses the history value at `p.tau` in the past, we can define:

```julia
dudt!(u, h, p, t) = model([u; h(t - p.tau)])
prob = DDEProblem(dudt_, u0, h, tspan, nothing)
```


First let's build training data from the same example as the neural ODE:

```julia
using Plots, Statistics
using DiffEqFlux, StochasticDiffEq, DiffEqBase.EnsembleAnalysis

u0 = Float32[2.; 0.]
datasize = 30
tspan = (0.0f0, 1.0f0)
tsteps = range(tspan[1], tspan[2], length = datasize)
```

```julia
function trueSDEfunc(du, u, p, t)
    true_A = [-0.1 2.0; -2.0 -0.1]
    du .= ((u.^3)'true_A)'
end

mp = Float32[0.2, 0.2]
function true_noise_func(du, u, p, t)
    du .= mp.*u
end

prob_truesde = SDEProblem(trueSDEfunc, true_noise_func, u0, tspan)
```

For our dataset we will use DifferentialEquations.jl's [parallel ensemble
interface](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/dev/features/ensemble.html) to generate
data from the average of 10,000 runs of the SDE:

```julia
# Take a typical sample from the mean
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob_truesde)
ensemble_sol = solve(ensemble_prob, SOSRI(), trajectories = 10000)
ensemble_sum = EnsembleSummary(ensemble_sol)

sde_data, sde_data_vars = Array.(timeseries_point_meanvar(ensemble_sol, tsteps))
```

Now we build a neural SDE. For simplicity we will use the `NeuralDSDE`
neural SDE with diagonal noise layer function:

```julia
drift_dudt = FastChain((x, p) -> x.^3,
                       FastDense(2, 50, tanh),
                       FastDense(50, 2))
diffusion_dudt = FastChain(FastDense(2, 2))

neuralsde = NeuralDSDE(drift_dudt, diffusion_dudt, tspan, SOSRI(),
                       saveat = tsteps, reltol = 1e-1, abstol = 1e-1)
```

Let's see what that looks like:

```julia
# Get the prediction using the correct initial condition
prediction0 = neuralsde(u0)

drift_(u, p, t) = drift_dudt(u, p[1:neuralsde.len])
diffusion_(u, p, t) = diffusion_dudt(u, p[(neuralsde.len+1):end])

prob_neuralsde = SDEProblem(drift_, diffusion_, u0,(0.0f0, 1.2f0), neuralsde.p)

ensemble_nprob = EnsembleProblem(prob_neuralsde)
ensemble_nsol = solve(ensemble_nprob, SOSRI(), trajectories = 100,
                      saveat = tsteps)
ensemble_nsum = EnsembleSummary(ensemble_nsol)

plt1 = plot(ensemble_nsum, title = "Neural SDE: Before Training")
scatter!(plt1, tsteps, sde_data', lw = 3)

scatter(tsteps, sde_data[1,:], label = "data")
scatter!(tsteps, prediction0[1,:], label = "prediction")
```

Now just as with the neural ODE we define a loss function that calculates the
mean and variance from `n` runs at each time point and uses the distance from
the data values:

```julia
function predict_neuralsde(p, u = u0)
  return Array(neuralsde(u, p))
end

function loss_neuralsde(p; n = 100)
  u = repeat(reshape(u0, :, 1), 1, n)
  samples = predict_neuralsde(p, u)
  means = mean(samples, dims = 2)
  vars = var(samples, dims = 2, mean = means)[:, 1, :]
  means = means[:, 1, :]
  loss = sum(abs2, sde_data - means) + sum(abs2, sde_data_vars - vars)
  return loss, means, vars
end
```

```julia
list_plots = []
iter = 0

# Callback function to observe training
callback = function (p, loss, means, vars; doplot = false)
  global list_plots, iter

  if iter == 0
    list_plots = []
  end
  iter += 1

  # loss against current data
  display(loss)

  # plot current prediction against data
  plt = Plots.scatter(tsteps, sde_data[1,:], yerror = sde_data_vars[1,:],
                     ylim = (-4.0, 8.0), label = "data")
  Plots.scatter!(plt, tsteps, means[1,:], ribbon = vars[1,:], label = "prediction")
  push!(list_plots, plt)

  if doplot
    display(plt)
  end
  return false
end
```

Now we train using this loss function. We can pre-train a little bit using a
smaller `n` and then decrease it after it has had some time to adjust towards
the right mean behavior:

```julia
opt = ADAM(0.025)

# First round of training with n = 10
result1 = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train((p) -> loss_neuralsde(p, n = 10),  
                                 neuralsde.p, opt,
                                 cb = callback, maxiters = 100)
```

We resume the training with a larger `n`. (WARNING - this step is a couple of
orders of magnitude longer than the previous one).

```julia
result2 = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train((p) -> loss_neuralsde(p, n = 100),
                                 result1.u, opt,
                                 cb = callback, maxiters = 100)
```

And now we plot the solution to an ensemble of the trained neural SDE:

```julia
_, means, vars = loss_neuralsde(result2.u, n = 1000)

plt2 = Plots.scatter(tsteps, sde_data', yerror = sde_data_vars',
                     label = "data", title = "Neural SDE: After Training",
                     xlabel = "Time")
plot!(plt2, tsteps, means', lw = 8, ribbon = vars', label = "prediction")

plt = plot(plt1, plt2, layout = (2, 1))
savefig(plt, "NN_sde_combined.png"); nothing # sde
```

Try this with GPUs as well!
