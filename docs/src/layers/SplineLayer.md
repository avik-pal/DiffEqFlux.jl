# Spline Layer

Constructs a Spline Layer. At a high-level, it performs the following:

1. Takes as input a one-dimensional training dataset, a time span, a time step and
   an interpolation method.
2. During training, adjusts the values of the function at multiples of the time-step
   such that the curve interpolated through these points has minimum loss on the corresponding
   one-dimensional dataset.
